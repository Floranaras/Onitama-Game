# Onitama Game

A complete C implementation of the two-player turn-based strategy game Onitama.

## Game Description

Onitama is a strategic board game where each player controls five pieces (one master and four students). The objective is to either capture the opponent's master or navigate your own master to occupy the opponent's temple.

### Game Components
- 5x5 game board with temple positions
- 2 master pieces (Red 'R' and Blue 'B')
- 8 student pieces (red 'r' and blue 'b')
- 16 move cards with unique movement patterns
- Neutral card system for turn determination

### Win Conditions
1. **Master Capture**: Capture the opponent's master piece
2. **Temple Victory**: Move your master to the opponent's temple (center of opposite side)
   - Blue wins by reaching (0,2)
   - Red wins by reaching (4,2)

## How to Play

### Game Setup
1. Run the game using `./onitama` or `make run`
2. Enter player names for Blue and Red players
3. Cards are automatically shuffled and dealt (2 per player, 1 neutral)
4. The player matching the neutral card's color goes first

### Gameplay Flow
1. **View Board**: See current game state from your perspective
2. **Choose Action**: 
   - Make a Move
   - View Your Cards
   - View Opponent's Cards
   - View Neutral Card
   - Clear Screen
3. **Make Move**:
   - Select one of your two move cards (0 or 1)
   - Choose coordinates of piece to move (row col format)
   - Choose destination coordinates
   - Used card swaps with neutral card

### Move Card System
- Each card shows movement patterns relative to piece position
- `X` marks the piece's current position
- `x` marks valid destination squares
- Cards have different patterns for Red and Blue players
- Movement is mirrored for opposite colors

### Special Features
- **Perspective Switching**: Board rotates based on current player
- **Move Validation**: Prevents invalid moves with helpful error messages
- **Automatic Win Detection**: Game ends when win conditions are met
- **No Valid Moves**: Automatic card swap when no moves available

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate files for different game aspects
- **Header System**: Centralized definitions in onitama.h with specific headers
- **Memory Safe**: Proper memory management and bounds checking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Test Coverage**: Complete test suite for quality assurance

### Key Data Structures

```c
// Game state database
typedef struct databaseTag {
    char board[SIDE][SIDE];                    // 5x5 game board
    cardType cardDb[MAX_CARDS];               // All available cards
    int playerCards[2][CARDS_PER_PLAYER];     // Player hand indices
    int neutralCard;                          // Neutral card index
    String50 p1, p2;                         // Player names
    int bCurrentPlayer;                       // Current turn (BLUE/RED)
    int bGameOver;                            // Game state flag
    int bWinner;                              // Winner (BLUE/RED)
    int bWinCondition;                        // Win type (TEMPLE/SENSEI)
    pointType blueTemple, redTemple;          // Temple positions
    moveType gameMoves[MAX_GAME_MOVES];       // Move history
    int gameMovesCtr;                         // Move counter
} databaseType;
```

## Development

### Code Standards
- **C99 Compliance**: Strict adherence to C99 standard
- **Wall Flag**: All warnings enabled and addressed
- **No Global Variables**: Proper parameter passing
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive function and variable names
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and function headers
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test suite ensures code quality

### File Dependencies
The project uses a modular include system:
- `main.c` includes `include/menu.h`
- Each module includes its specific header file
- All headers include `onitama.h` for common definitions
- Test suite includes all necessary headers for validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File not found errors**: Ensure `data/` directory contains `movecards.txt` and individual card files
2. **Compilation errors**: Check that all source files are in the correct directories
3. **Link errors**: Make sure all object files are properly compiled before linking
4. **Test failures**: Run the test suite to identify specific implementation issues
5. **Missing headers**: Ensure all header files are in the `include/` directory

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows
- **Make not found**: See [Getting Make on Windows](#getting-make-on-windows) section
- **Permission errors**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator if needed
- **Path issues**: Use `build.cmd` if make commands don't work

#### Linux/macOS
- **GCC not installed**: Install build tools (`sudo apt install build-essential` on Ubuntu)
- **Permission denied**: Check file permissions (`chmod +x` for executables)

### Debugging

#### Verify Setup
```bash
make check          # Verify all files present
make info           # Show build configuration
make platform-info  # Show platform details
```

#### Clean Rebuild
```bash
make clean          # Remove all build artifacts
make                # Clean build
```

#### Debug Build
```bash
make debug          # Build with debug symbols
